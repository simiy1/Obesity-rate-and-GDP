Group members: Jasper Fan-Chiang, Bonnie Du,  Siming Yin
Group number: G1

## Problem Domain

Nowadays, obesity is viewed by authorities as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century.
Obesity is a disorder involving excessive body fat that increases the risk of health problems. In general, obesity is overweighted.
Obesity is correlated with various diseases and conditions, for example, heart disease, diabetes, certain kinds of cancers, and even mental health issues.
According to the data in 2015, there are 600 million adults and 100 million children were obese in 195 countries.
Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide.

GDP is used to measure the prosperity of a country during a certain period. By examining the GDP value for each country, we can determinate the development and progress of a country. This is one of the important measurement or powerful statistical indicator for comparing the national economies development in the international market.

Our group find that is interesting to discuss the relationship between obesity and GDP. Since GDP is related to national economies and obesity has individual, socioeconomic, and environmental causes. We want to discover how population obesity prevalence is associated with economic affluence, whether obesity can become a potential negative outcome with economics growth, and whether or not the development of a country will lead to the growth of overweighted people. Through study the GDP and obesity, we will try to find the pattern or relationship between these two, in order to let people realize and that obesity is one of the serious worldwide disease and pay more attention to their health

  - this question can give us a broad view about the changes of obesity rate in every county. Are people getting fatter nowadays?
- Comparison between male and female’s obesity rates
  - The comparison will show the differences between male and female,  and give us information about which gender care more about their weight.
- Which Top 20 countries’ obesity rate are the highest in the recent ten years? Which Top 20 countries’ GDP grown the fastest in the recent ten years? Are there any polymerization?
  - This question will help us combines the Top 20 countries from each data sets and find whether they have any connection between GDP and obesity rate
- What is the relationship between the obesity rate and GDP for every countries?
  - Does people get more when GDP grow much higher? Or do they eat healthier? We want to combine those data sets to find out the connected between them in every counties.
- In a smaller scale, based on the relationship between GDP and obesity rate over the world, will there be any similar relationship inside US?
  - Try to find whether the result from the broad view also use in the comparison between each states in US.
